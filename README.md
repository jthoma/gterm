# gterm
GDS Terminal implemented using php-cli and works from cli

## Instructions 

Dont think much is here, and might not be needed. Since things are changing and more robust
wrappers are available this is just for future reference.

Could be run directly from cli with

/usr/bin/php -q #full path to#/gterm/gTerm.php


Also you can export an alias by adding the following to .bash_alias or .zsh_rc

alias gterm='/usr/bin/php -q #full path to#/gterm/gTerm.php'
